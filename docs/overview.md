# Farplace Overview

## What is Farplace?

Farplace is a token launchpad on Base that distributes tokens through gamified mechanisms instead of traditional token sales. Rather than conventional ICOs, presales, or airdrops, Farplace uses competitive games -- mining, spinning, and funding -- to put tokens into the hands of participants over time.

The platform runs as a Farcaster mini-app. Anyone can launch a token by pairing it with USDC to create initial liquidity on Uniswap V2. That initial liquidity is permanently locked: LP tokens are burned to the dead address (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`), meaning liquidity can never be withdrawn by anyone.

All contracts are deployed on Base (chain ID 8453) and are non-upgradeable. Once a token is launched, its distribution parameters are immutable.

## How It Works

Every token launch on Farplace creates three interconnected contracts:

- **Rig** -- The distribution mechanism that emits tokens over time through a specific game mechanic. Each rig type has its own rules for how participants earn tokens.
- **Unit** -- The ERC20 token itself. Each launch creates a new token with permit and voting (ERC20Votes) capabilities. Only the rig can mint new tokens, and this minting authority is permanently locked at launch.
- **Auction** -- A Dutch auction contract that accumulates treasury fees from the rig and sells them to buyers in exchange for LP tokens, which are then burned. This creates continuous buy pressure on the token while reducing circulating LP supply.

### The Launch Flow

1. A launcher provides USDC and specifies their token parameters (name, symbol, initial supply, emission schedule, game configuration).
2. A Unit token is deployed and paired with the launcher's USDC to create a Uniswap V2 liquidity pool.
3. The LP tokens from that pool are burned permanently -- no one can pull the liquidity.
4. A Rig is deployed with the chosen game mechanics. The rig becomes the sole minter of the Unit token.
5. An Auction contract is deployed to handle treasury fee distribution.
6. Ownership of the rig transfers to the launcher, who can adjust operational parameters (treasury address, team address, metadata) but cannot change the core game mechanics.

From that point forward, the rig distributes tokens according to its programmed rules. Participants interact with the rig (mining, spinning, or donating) to earn Unit tokens. Fees generated by the rig flow to the treasury (Auction), the team (launcher), and the protocol.

## Key Properties

- **Immutable game mechanics.** Once a rig is deployed, its core parameters (emission rate, halving schedule, epoch period, price multiplier) cannot be changed. The launcher chooses these at creation time and they are locked forever.

- **Permanently locked liquidity.** Initial LP tokens are burned to the dead address. There is no admin key, no timelock, and no mechanism to withdraw the liquidity. This is enforced at the contract level during launch.

- **Permissionless launches.** Anyone can launch a token by providing the minimum required USDC. There is no approval process, whitelist, or governance vote required.

- **Non-upgradeable contracts.** All contracts (Registry, Core, Factory, Rig, Unit, Auction) are deployed without proxy patterns. The code running at deployment is the code that runs forever.

- **Fair distribution through game mechanics.** Tokens are not pre-sold or airdropped. They are earned through participation in the rig's game -- whether that means competing for mining slots, spinning for prizes, or donating to a cause.

- **Decaying fee structure.** All rig types use Dutch auction-style pricing that decays linearly over each epoch. Activity resets the price upward; inactivity lets it decay to zero. This creates natural price discovery driven by demand.

## Three Rig Types

### MineRig (Slot Mining)

Users compete for mining slots via Dutch auction pricing. While holding a slot, a miner earns continuous Unit token emissions proportional to time held. When displaced by a new miner, the outgoing miner receives 80% of the slot purchase price. Slots can optionally have random UPS multipliers (1x-10x) assigned via Pyth Entropy VRF. Emissions follow a Bitcoin-like halving schedule based on total tokens minted.

### SpinRig (Slot Machine)

Users pay a Dutch auction price to spin for a chance to win Unit tokens from a continuously growing prize pool. On each spin, accumulated emissions are minted into the pool, then Pyth Entropy VRF draws a random payout percentage from the configured odds array. The prize pool grows whether or not anyone is spinning, and emissions halve on a wall-clock schedule.

### FundRig (Donations)

Users donate a payment token into daily pools. After each day ends, donors claim their proportional share of that day's Unit emission based on how much they contributed relative to total donations. Donations are split instantly: 50% to the recipient, 45% to treasury, 4% to team, 1% to protocol. Emissions halve on a wall-clock schedule measured in days.
