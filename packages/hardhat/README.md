## Overview

When someone launches a token on Farplace, the system:

1. Deploys an ERC20 token (Unit) with voting/permit support
2. Creates a Unit/USDC liquidity pool on Uniswap V2
3. Burns the LP tokens permanently (liquidity can never be removed)
4. Deploys a Rig contract that controls all future token minting
5. Deploys an Auction contract for treasury LP buybacks
6. Locks minting rights to the Rig (one-time, irreversible)

The launcher chooses one of three rig types, each with different distribution mechanics. All three share the same token, LP, and auction infrastructure.

---

## Rig Types

### MineRig - Competitive Mining

Users compete for mining slots via Dutch auction. The active miner earns token emissions over time. When someone takes over a slot, the previous miner gets paid.

**How it works:**

```
Epoch 1: Price starts at initPrice, decays linearly to 0
  Alice pays 0.5 USDC when price hits that level
  Alice is now mining slot 0, earning tokens at UPS rate

Epoch 2: Price resets to 0.5 * priceMultiplier
  Bob pays 0.8 USDC to take over
  Alice receives: her mined tokens + 0.64 USDC (80% of Bob's payment)
  Bob is now mining

Epoch 3+: Cycle continues...
```

**Fee split on each mine:**

| Recipient | Share | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Previous Miner | 80% | Reward for holding the slot |
| Treasury | 15% | Accumulates for LP auctions |
| Team | 4% | Launcher's revenue |
| Protocol | 1% | Platform fee |

**Token emissions:**

- Each slot earns `globalUps / capacity` tokens per second
- `globalUps` halves based on total tokens minted (supply-based halving)
- Halving uses a geometric threshold: first halving at `halvingAmount`, second at `halvingAmount + halvingAmount/2`, third at `halvingAmount + halvingAmount/2 + halvingAmount/4`, etc.
- Emissions floor at `tailUps` (never stops completely)

**Multi-slot support:**

- Rigs start with 1 slot, owner can increase up to 256
- Total emission rate stays constant regardless of capacity (divided equally among slots)
- Each slot has its own independent Dutch auction and miner

**UPS Multipliers (optional):**

- When enabled, each mine requests VRF randomness from Pyth Entropy
- A random multiplier (1x-10x) is applied to that slot's emission rate
- Multiplier expires after `upsMultiplierDuration`, resetting to 1x on next mine
- Requires ETH for the entropy fee

**Miner fee distribution:**

Previous miners accumulate claimable balances (pull pattern). They call `claim()` to withdraw, or the Multicall auto-claims on their behalf during the next mine.

---

### SpinRig - Slot Machine

Users pay to spin a slot machine. A VRF-determined random outcome decides what percentage of the prize pool they win.

**How it works:**

```
1. Token emissions accumulate in the prize pool over time
2. User pays the current Dutch auction price to spin
3. Pyth Entropy provides a random number via VRF callback
4. Random number selects an odds entry from the configured array
5. User wins that percentage of the current prize pool
```

**Fee split on each spin:**

| Recipient | Share | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Treasury | 95% | Accumulates for LP auctions |
| Team | 4% | Launcher's revenue |
| Protocol | 1% | Platform fee |

**Odds configuration:**

The launcher defines an array of possible payout percentages (in basis points). Each spin randomly selects one entry.

Example: `odds = [100, 500, 1000, 5000]` means each spin has equal chance of winning 1%, 5%, 10%, or 50% of the prize pool. Maximum single payout is 80% (`MAX_ODDS_BPS = 8000`), ensuring the pool never fully drains.

**Token emissions:**

- Emissions are time-based: `timeElapsed * currentUps`
- `currentUps` halves every `halvingPeriod` seconds
- Emissions are minted to the prize pool (the SpinRig contract itself) on each spin
- Emissions floor at `tailUps`

**VRF mechanics:**

Every spin requires an entropy fee (paid in ETH). The Pyth Entropy contract calls back with randomness, and the payout is calculated and transferred in the callback. If multiple spins happen before callbacks resolve, each callback uses the live prize pool balance at callback time.

---

### FundRig - Donation Pool

Users donate payment tokens to a daily pool. Donations are split between a designated recipient and the treasury. At the end of each day, donors claim their proportional share of that day's token emission.

**How it works:**

```
Day 0: Emission = 1000 tokens
  Alice donates 60 USDC, Bob donates 40 USDC
  Total donations: 100 USDC

  50 USDC -> recipient (charity, creator, etc.)
  45 USDC -> treasury (for LP auctions)
   4 USDC -> team
   1 USDC -> protocol

Day 1: Alice claims 600 tokens (60%), Bob claims 400 tokens (40%)

Day 1: Emission = 1000 tokens (same until halving)
  ...cycle continues
```

**Fee split on each donation:**

| Recipient | Share | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Recipient | 50% | The cause/creator being funded |
| Treasury | 45% | Accumulates for LP auctions |
| Team | 4% | Launcher's revenue |
| Protocol | 1% | Platform fee |

**Token emissions:**

- Each day has a fixed emission amount: `initialEmission >> (day / halvingPeriod)`
- Halving is day-count based (e.g., every 30 days)
- Floor at `minEmission`
- Donors claim proportionally: `(userDonation / dayTotal) * dayEmission`

**Claiming:**

- Claims are available once the day ends (day < currentDay)
- Each account can claim once per day
- No double claims (tracked per account per day)
- Multicall provides batch claiming across multiple days

**Minimum donation:** 10,000 wei of the payment token (prevents dust donations that produce zero fee splits).

## Shared Infrastructure

### Launch Sequence

All three rig types follow the same launch flow, orchestrated by their respective Core contract:

```
User calls Core.launch(params)
    |
    +-- 1. Validate Core-specific params (launcher, quoteToken, usdc, name, symbol, unitAmount)
    +-- 2. Transfer USDC from launcher
    +-- 3. Deploy Unit token (ERC20 with voting/permit)
    +-- 4. Mint initial Unit tokens for LP seeding
    +-- 5. Create Uniswap V2 pair (Unit/USDC), add liquidity
    +-- 6. Burn LP tokens to 0x000...dEaD (permanent liquidity)
    +-- 7. Deploy Auction contract (LP buyback mechanism)
    +-- 8. Deploy Rig contract via factory (validates rig-specific params)
    +-- 9. Lock minting rights: Unit.setRig(rig) (one-time, irreversible)
    +-- 10. Transfer Rig ownership to launcher
    +-- 11. Register with central Registry
```

### Unit Token

Every launch creates a new Unit (ERC20) with:

- **ERC20Permit** - Gasless approvals via signatures
- **ERC20Votes** - On-chain governance voting support
- **Controlled minting** - Only the Rig contract can mint, permanently locked via one-time `setRig()`
- **No supply cap** - Supply is bounded only by the rig's halving schedule and tail emission
- **Burn support** - Anyone can burn their own tokens

### Dutch Auction Pricing

All rig types and the Auction contract use the same Dutch auction mechanism:

```
Price = initPrice * (epochPeriod - elapsed) / epochPeriod
```

Price starts at `initPrice` and decays linearly to 0 over `epochPeriod`. When someone buys:
- A new epoch starts
- `initPrice` is set to `max(pricePaid * priceMultiplier, minInitPrice)`

This makes front-running unprofitable (being first means paying the highest price) and provides natural price discovery.

### Treasury Auctions

Each rig has an associated Auction contract. Treasury fees (15-95% depending on rig type) accumulate as the rig's quote token in the Auction contract. Anyone can buy the accumulated tokens by paying with LP tokens, which are sent to the burn address.

This creates deflationary pressure on the LP supply: as more treasury fees accumulate and get auctioned off, LP tokens are permanently removed from circulation.

### Registry

A central Registry contract tracks all deployed rigs across all types. Only approved Core contracts (factories) can register new rigs. The Registry provides:

- Enumeration of all rigs (paginated)
- Filtering by rig type ("mine", "spin", "fund")
- Lookup of rig metadata (type, unit token, launcher, creation time)

## Security Model

### Immutable After Launch

- Token name and symbol
- Quote token (payment token)
- All emission parameters (UPS, halving, tail)
- All price parameters (epoch period, multiplier, min price)
- Odds array (SpinRig)
- Recipient address split percentages (all rigs)
- Initial liquidity (LP burned to dead address)
- Minting rights (permanently locked to Rig)

### Mutable by Rig Owner

- Treasury address
- Team address (can be set to zero to disable)
- Metadata URI
- Capacity (MineRig only, can only increase)
- Recipient address (FundRig only)

### Cannot Be Done

- Mint tokens outside the Rig mechanism
- Remove or reduce initial liquidity
- Pause, stop, or freeze any rig
- Change emission rates or price mechanics
- Upgrade contracts (all are non-upgradeable)

### Protections

- **ReentrancyGuard** on all state-changing entry points
- **SafeERC20** for all token transfers
- **Frontrun protection** via epochId, deadline, and maxPrice on all user-facing functions
- **Pull-pattern** for MineRig miner fee distribution (prevents DoS via reverting recipients)
- **VRF randomness** via Pyth Entropy for SpinRig and MineRig multipliers

### Unsupported Token Types

The following are **not supported** as quote/payment tokens:

- **Fee-on-transfer tokens** (transfer amount != received amount)
- **Rebasing tokens** (balances change without transfers)
- **Tokens with blocklists** (may cause unexpected reverts)

Use standard ERC20 tokens: USDC, WETH, DAI, etc.
